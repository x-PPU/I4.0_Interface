	abstract = "Nowadays, there are various use cases and proprietary demonstrators for Industry 4.0 or Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) developed, operated and maintained by the one or other research institutions. Within the development of new technologies for Industry 4.0, such demonstrators are used, which allow the interaction with the physical world, i.e. the machinery containing sensors and actuators. In this paper, we propose a concept that allows remote access using an Industry 4.0 interface on an open lab size automated production system (aPS) that has been available and used as a research community demonstrator for more than 5 years. Besides availability of evolution scenarios in various models and codes, offering the possibility to conduct experiments from remote enables easier access and opportunities to interact with an aPS and provides a basis for concepts like production as a service and other research areas. The proposed concept is based on a model-driven approach that allows a dynamic reconfiguration of automation control code and generates a middleware interface. The middleware dynamically offers the possibility to retrieve information about the aPS and allows the control of the aPS via web services."
